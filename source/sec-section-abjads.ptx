  <title>Abjads-Consonant Alphabets</title>

  <p> Abjads, or consonant alphabets, represent consonants only, or consonants plus some
vowels. Full vowel indication (vocalisation) can be added, usually by means of diacritics, but this is not usualy done. Most of abjads, with the exception of Ugaritic,
are written from right to left. There are three abjads currently in use: Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac. Abjads, or consonant alphabets, represent consonants only, or consonants plus some vowels. </p>
